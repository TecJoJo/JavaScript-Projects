Hi, there, this is a project following an awsome free online-tutorial "JaveScript Programming - Full Course" made by freeCodeCamp.org. 
I do understand every detail of this project and gonna learn more about JavaScript.
Hoping to seek for some improvment on this project on my own, adding features like deleting seperately saved lead.
