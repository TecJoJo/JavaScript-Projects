Hello getting started with grapping the basic understanding of JS, now i am moving forword, the goal right now is following 
a course named 15 JavaScrip Projects.
Codes of course would seems almost the same as the tutorial being written, but would be slightly diffent, because it won't be 
just copy and past, but following the template of Learning and Do it by yourself.
